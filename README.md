Replication of Universality and individuality in neural dynamics across large populations of recurrent networks
by Maheswaranathan et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08549.

Top: inputs, outputs, and trajectories in PC space of a vanilla RNN with tanh nonlinearity trained to integrate its inputs. Gray dots indicate fixed points. Bottom: RNN with relu nonlinearity. The networks use the same dynamical object -a line integrator- to solve the task, but with different geometries.
